      "     Mae Miller is at a crossroads. Talented, ambitious, and restless, she dreams of leaving Northridge for a full scholarship in New York‚Äîbut first, she faces the messy realities of the life she‚Äôs built. Living with Jess Barbosa, a kind and earnest music enthusiast who‚Äôs quietly holding their world together, Mae struggles with the tension between love and her own ambitions. In a quirky attempt to free herself, she sets out to find Jess a new girlfriend, thinking it‚Äôs her ticket to escape. But even as she orchestrates these humorous and awkward encounters, her feelings for Jess remain undeniable.",
      "     Between the chaos of diner kitchens, bustling farmer‚Äôs markets, and jazzy clarinet tunes that follow her everywhere, Mae‚Äôs journey is full of music, laughter, and heart. Along the way, she confronts her fears about leaving, her attachments to the people and rhythms of her hometown, and the deeper truth about what she truly wants. Jess, patient and loving, becomes both a mirror and a challenge to Mae, forcing her to question whether running away is really freedom‚Äîor just avoidance.",
      "     As Mae navigates love, ambition, and the hilarious fallout of her matchmaking scheme, she must make a choice that could change everything. Will she follow her dreams, or will her heart keep her grounded? ‚ÄúNorth by Northridge‚Äù is a vibrant, musical tale of love, self-discovery, and the fine line between chasing dreams and holding on to what matters most."
